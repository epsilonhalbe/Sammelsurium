## PXMParser

is a parser for images of the type `*.pbm`, `*.pgm` and `*.ppm` written with
attoparsec, it is a first effort in using it and I am quite happy with that

- DONE: Parsing images with magic value 'P5' and 'P6' is not yet implemented
- TODO: Clean up messy parsing of word16 values
- TODO: Write tests
